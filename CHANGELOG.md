# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

- Fix memory leak in WebSocket clients: message allocations are now freed before each `receive()` call instead of accumulating for the lifetime of the connection. Message data is valid until the next call to `receive()`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-26

- Support for Zig 0.16, still depends on zio, not using `std.Io` due to lack of timeout support.
- Fix flushing in websocket client when using it over HTTPS.
- Added support for 100-continue in the HTTP client.
